In the heart of Paris, under the twinkling lights of the Eiffel Tower, there stood a magical snowman named Pierre. Built by a group of excited children, Pierre was no ordinary snowman; he had a twinkle in his coal eyes and a smile that could warm even the coldest of Parisian nights.

Pierre had round, rosy cheeks made from the reddest of apples, a carrot nose that was perfectly crooked, and a top hat that once belonged to a famous magician. His body donned a festive red scarf that fluttered in the winter breeze.

One enchanted evening, as the moonlight danced upon the Seine River, Pierre came to life. His first steps were wobbly, but soon he found his balance and began to explore the magical city of lights.
