Lillyâ€™s next stop was the charming Crooked House, a building that looked as if it had sprung from the pages of a fairy tale. Its walls wobbled and swayed, and its windows seemed to dance. Lilly marveled at the house's unusual shape, its twisting, curvy architecture a delightful sight against the backdrop of bustling Monte Cassino Street.

Further on, Lilly discovered the beautiful Sopot Lighthouse. With its tall, white-washed tower and bright red top, it stood proudly against the deep blue of the sky. Lilly climbed to the top, each step revealing more of the breathtaking view of the Baltic Sea, sparkling like a sea of diamonds in the sunlight.

By the end of her adventures, Lilly felt her heart brimming with joy from the beauty and magic of Sopot. As the sun began to set, painting the sky in shades of pink and orange, she knew that Sopot had given her a treasure trove of summer memories.
