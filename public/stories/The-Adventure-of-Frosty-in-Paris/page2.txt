Frosty decided to explore the wonders of Paris with Amélie. Together, they slid along snowy sidewalks, passed bakery windows filled with golden pastries, and wandered through the enchanting Tuileries Garden, where the trees were dusted with snow, creating a picture-perfect wonderland.

As evening fell, the city lights began to twinkle, and Amélie and Frosty made their way to the Seine River. The water shimmered with reflections of the illuminated bridges and buildings. A soft snow began to fall, making everything feel magical.

In front of the grand Notre-Dame Cathedral, Amélie and Frosty twirled in circles, laughing and dancing. Frosty's scarf fluttered in the gentle winter breeze, and Amélie’s laughter echoed through the Parisian night. As the clock struck eight, they knew it was time for Frosty to return to his corner.

With a heartfelt hug, Amélie whispered, "I'll visit you again tomorrow, Frosty." The snowman nodded, his button eyes full of joy and warmth, knowing that Paris had become a little brighter with their newfound friendship.
