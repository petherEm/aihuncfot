In the heart of a chic, wintery Paris, a small snowman named Frosty came to life. With a carrot nose, button eyes, and a scarf made of colorful fabric strips, Frosty stood on a quaint street corner. His body was plump and perfectly round, with a cheerful smile that could warm even the coldest of days.

One sunny day, a little girl named Amélie found Frosty while walking with her mother. Amélie had curly brown hair that tumbled down her shoulders and sparkly blue eyes. Her cheeks were rosy from the cold, and she wore a bright red coat with matching mittens. She gasped in delight when she saw Frosty, who greeted her with twinkling button eyes.

The streets of Paris were wrapped in a white blanket of snow, making the city look like a scene from a fairytale. The Eiffel Tower glittered in the background, its iron lattice adorned with tiny icicles. Nearby, charming cafes with outdoor seating provided a cozy spot for Parisians to sip hot cocoa under warm lantern lights.
