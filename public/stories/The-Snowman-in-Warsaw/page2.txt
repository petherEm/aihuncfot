But as fun as their adventures were, Snowy began to realize that he could only remain until the sun started to warm the city, threatening to melt him away. Anna understood this and promised to make the most of their time together. They played in ≈Åazienki Park, an enchanted winter wonderland with its snow-covered trees and serene atmosphere. Peacocks wandered around the park, their feathers glistening with frost.

One evening, as a full moon lit up the winter sky, Anna and Snowy shared a special moment in front of the Mermaid Statue at Warsaw's market square. The statue stood tall and proud, with the mermaid's sword raised high, a guardian of the city. Snowy spoke softly to Anna, "Even though I must go when the snow melts, I will always be with you in spirit. Remember our adventures and the joy we shared."

Anna hugged Snowy tightly, her eyes brimming with tears yet filled with happiness. She knew that friendships like theirs were rare and precious. As the days grew warmer, Snowy slowly melted away, but in his place, he left behind the memories that Anna would cherish forever.

Every year when winter arrived, Anna would build a new snowman, just like Snowy, and tell her friends the story of the magical snowman in Warsaw who had brought so much joy and wonder into her life.
